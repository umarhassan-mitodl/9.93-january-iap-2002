description: Image showing activation in the frontal cortex of a patient with global
  amnesia. Yellow areas show activation in the frontal cortex of a patient with global
  amnesia due to medial temporal lobe damage, revealing that the processes that support
  retrieval from semantic memory remain intact in amnesia. (Image by Prof. Anthony
  Wagner.)
